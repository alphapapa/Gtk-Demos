# Gtk-Demos
Brief demos of using Gtk user interface from a high level language without any C or makefiles.

See the intro file for explanation/description.

No need to compile anything.  The demos are scripts, ready to run.

To run the demos:


chmod +x demo1 demo2 demo3

./demo1 ; ./demo2 ; ./demo3
